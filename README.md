# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  DriverPass is looking to fill a void they found in the driving test market by providing better driving training for people trying to pass their driving test at their local DMV. 
  They need a system to support the creation of reservations for the training packages DriverPass provides. Including the managing of the driver and customer information.

What did you do particularly well?

  I was able to extract the objectives and goals from the interveiw.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  The number one thing I'd like to revise is my use case diagram. I feel it doesn't not fully incapcilate the system so I will need to add and improve use cases.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I considered the user's needs by picturing me using the system as well as if my grandparents were. Thinking through how each type of user will interact with the system be it a GUI or terminal. This adds to increased usablilty and is best if thought of from the begainning. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  From my previous class I have an agile mindset and now adding all the different diagrams and interview skills I feel they will help me to get a good understanding of what the customer wants and break it down into wants and needs.
